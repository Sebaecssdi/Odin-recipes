    <h2 class="subtitle"> Description </h2>
    <p class="list">This is one hundred percent Chilean. It is a sort of caramel that can be found everywhere in Chile. Actually, most pastry making in my country has manjar in it. The truth is that one can eat manjar anytime during the day and in many different ways: with bread, cheese, cookies, and my favorite, with meringue. Some of my foreign friends love it, some others hate it, so I guess you must give it a try and judge.    </p>
